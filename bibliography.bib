abstract="Business process modeling has become an important tool for managing organizational change and for capturing requirements of software. A central problem in this area is the fact that the acquisition of as-is models consumes up to 60{\%} of the time spent on process management projects. This is paradox as there are often extensive documentations available in companies, but not in a ready-to-use format. In this paper, we tackle this problem based on an automatic approach to generate BPMN models from natural language text. We combine existing tools from natural language processing in an innovative way and augmented them with a suitable anaphora resolution mechanism. The evaluation of our technique shows that for a set of 47 text-model pairs from industry and textbooks, we are able to generate on average 77{\%} of the models correctly.",

abstract="Oftentimes business processes exist not as singular entities that can be managed in isolation, but as families of variants that need to be managed together. When it comes to modelling these variants, analysts are faced with the dilemma of whether to model each variant separately or to model multiple or all variants as a single model. The former option leads to a proliferation of models that share common parts, leading to redundancy and possible inconsistency. The latter approach leads to less but more complex models, thus hindering on their comprehensibility. This paper presents a decomposition driven method to capture a family of process variants in a consolidated manner taking into account the above trade-off. We applied our method on a case study in the banking sector. A reduction of 50{\%} of duplication was achieved in this case study.",

ABSTRACT = {Designing business process models plays a vital role in business process management. The acquisition of such models may consume up to 60% of the project time. This time can be shortened using methods for the automatic or semi-automatic generation of process models. In this paper, we present a user-friendly method of business process composition. It uses a set of predefined constraints to generate a synthetic log of the process based on a simplified, unordered specification, which describes activities to be performed. Such a log can be used to generate a correct BPMN model. To achieve this, we propose the use of one of the existing process discovery algorithms or executing the activity graph-based composition algorithm, which generates the process model directly from the input log file. The proposed approach allows process participants to take part in process modeling. Moreover, it can be a support for business analysts or process designers in visualizing the workflow without the necessity to design the model explicitly in a graphical editor. The BPMN diagram is generated as an interchangeable XML file, which allows its further modification and adjustment. The included comparative analysis shows that our method is capable of generating process models characterized by high flow complexity and can support BPMN constructs, which are sufficient for about 70% of business cases.}

        abstract = {During their lifecycle, business processes are keen
to change. Changes either concern the process model structure or the accompanying rules; e.g. compliance rules (laws and regulations). In the context of business process collaborations, several process partners collaborate together, and changing one process might result in knock-on effects on the other processes; i.e., change propagation. Since business processes are often subject to restrictions that stem from laws, regulations or guidelines; i.e., compliance rules, changing them might lead to the violations
of these rules (non-compliability). So far, only the impacts of process changes in choreographies have been studied. In this work, we propose an approach that analyzes and evaluates the impacts of process changes on the different compliance rules and inversely, the impacts of compliance rule changes on the process choreography.}

However, changes of either intra- or cross-organizational processes must not be done in an uncontrolled manner. In particular, processes
are increasingly subject to compliance rules that usually stem from security constraints, corporate guidelines, standards, and laws. These compliance rules have to be considered when modeling business processes and changing existing ones. While change and compliance have been extensively discussed for intra-organizational business processes, albeit only in an isolated manner, their combination in the context of cross-organizational processes remains an open issue. In this paper, we discuss requirements and challenges to be tackled in order to ensure that changes of cross-organizational business processes preserve compliance with imposed regulations, standards and laws.}

        abstract = {A fundamental challenge for any process-aware information system is to ensure compliance of modeled and executed business processes with imposed compliance rules stemming from guidelines, standards and laws. Such compliance rules usually refer to multiple process perspectives including control flow, time, resources, data, and interactions with business partners. On one hand, compliance rules should be comprehensible for domain experts who must define and apply them. On the other, they should have a precise semantics such that they can be automatically processed. In this context, providing a visual compliance rule language seems promising as it allows hiding formal details and offers an
intuitive way of modeling. So far, visual compliance rule languages have focused on the control flow perspective, but lack adequate support for the other perspectives. To remedy this drawback, this paper provides an approach that extends visual compliance rule languages with the ability to consider data, time, resources, and partner interactions when modeling business process compliance rules. Overall, this extension will foster business process compliance support in practice.}

More precisely, we want to find a decomposition of a workflow graph into a hierarchy of sub-workflows that are subgraphs with a single entry and a single exit of control. Such a decomposition is the crucial step, for example, to translate a process modeled in a graph-based language such as BPMN into a process modeled in a block-based language such as BPEL. For this and other applications, it is desirable that the decomposition be unique, modular and as fine as possible, where modular means that a local change of the workflow graph can only cause a local change of the decomposition. In this paper, we provide a decomposition that is unique, modular and finer than in previous work. We call it the refined process structure tree. It is based on and extends similar work for sequential programs by Tarjan and Valdes [ACM POPL ‚Äô80, 1980, pp. 95‚Äì105]. We give two independent characterizations of the refined process structure tree which we prove to be equivalent: (1) a simple descriptive characterization that justifies our particular choice of the decomposition and (2) a constructive characterization that allows us to compute the decomposition in linear time. The latter is based on the tree of triconnected components (elsewhere also known as the SPQR tree) of a biconnected graph."
